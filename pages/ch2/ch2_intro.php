Even though it was midnight, the city of Tungsten was bright, like a lamp surrounded by darkness. No, not just that. <br><br>The city was alive. <br><br>
Everywhere where you looked, there were bakeries, candy stores, shoe parlors, all filled to the brim with people of all kinds. <br><br> 
One shop in particular drew my eye: a café, similar to the ones my parents had taken me to as a child. The smell of freshly made coffee and New Orleans style beignets wafted through the air. My mouth watered. <br><br>
As I started towards the café, the giant clock tower in the town’s center rang out. 11:00 PM. <br><br>
I was supposed to meet the group at midnight at the hotel, which was more than half an hour away by cab. <br><br>
