                I managed to hail a cab within a couple of minutes, which was incredibly lucky considering the busy nature of the city. <br><br>
“Where you are you going?”, the cab driver asked. <br><br>
“The Keystone Hotel”, I responded back. He responded with a nod. <br><br>
The drive was quiet. The driver didn’t seem like he was in the mood for talking. It gave me a chance to see the city life. <br><br>
We passed a large show of street performers on the way to the hotel. There was a large crowd of people. All waving their phone flashlights to the beat of the song. <br><br>
It was like a mini-concert. <br><br>
It reminded me of my favorite song, “Home” by Daughtry. It reminded me of my girlfriend from college, who introduced this song to me, and how we used to take long walks around campus listening to this song. <br><br>
