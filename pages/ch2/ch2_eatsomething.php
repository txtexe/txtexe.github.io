                I ordered a beignet and coffee, and sat down on a small wooden chair. <br><br>
The café was small. I remember my parents taking me to a café like this when I was a child. <br><br>
	“What’s that say?”, I remember saying. <br><br>
“That’s a beignet”, she said. My father ordered one for me. It quickly became my favorite food. <br><br>
I suddenly remembered the time, and took my food to go. <br><br>
