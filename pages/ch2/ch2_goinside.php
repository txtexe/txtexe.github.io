                  As I headed inside, I thanked and paid my driver. He nodded. I went to the back of the car to get my luggage. <br><br>
I pulled my luggage out of the car and headed inside the hotel. <br><br>
The hotel lobby was decorated to look like a homey log cabin, like one you might see at a ski resort, one that Abe Lincoln himself would have been envious of. <br><br>
There was a bearskin rug in the lobby’s center, with the head still attached. A chill ran down my spine as a I sidestepped it. <br><br>
The lobby seemed to be broken into three little areas: one little ‘hangout’ area in the center, one for checking in, and one for breakfast. <br><br>
A group of people had gathered in the room’s center. There seemed to be about eight in total. <br><br>
One member of the group, a large, bald, African American man with a friendly smile hollered me over. <br><br>
“Hello!”, he exclaimed, loud enough to initiate a ringing sound in my ears. “Name’s Devon!” <br><br>
