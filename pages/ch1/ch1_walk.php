                    Right. Rushing to the baggage claim wouldn’t help my situation. The bags wouldn’t arrive any quicker if I did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strolling through the halls of the airport gave me a chance to calm my nerves. 
                    I had plenty of reason to be nervous, sure, but anxiety had never helped me in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I couldn’t help but notice how beautiful the airport was. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The seats were a jet black colored leather, with clear steel frame. They were sturdy, enough to carry the people and the trouble they carried. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The walls were covered with paintings from all over the globe. Some told stories, while others depicted historical events of the city’s history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a picture that depicted the fall of the Roman Empire, and one that depicted one of the rise of the Byzantine Empire (the ones who succeeded the Roman Empire).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One picture reminded me of a story my mother used to tell when I was little. It was about this traveler, who traveled among the ancient civilizations like an ambassador. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ambassador was kind, intelligent, and well respected. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was tall, blonde, and good looking. Dreamy, as my mother would put it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She told me that he wore white, with little other color mixed in. My mother called it a symbol of hope. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mom told tales about him for years, until I went to college. She could have written a book on the stories she told. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I convinced her to do that five years ago, the summer before my freshman year. On instinct, I reached down to the unfinished copy of ‘TXT.EXE’ in carry-on bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A strange title for a book, I know, but I was never able to convince her to change the title to something like “Black Snow”. Mom was always stubborn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I reached the baggage claim without getting too lost. Surprising, considering the size of the airport.
                    Bags had just starting coming in. There was no sizeable crowd either.
                    At least something was going my way.
                </p>
                <p>As I waited, a man, about six feet tall, walked up next to me.</p>
