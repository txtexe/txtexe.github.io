                   Right. I didn't have time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was almost jogging at this point. My heavy carry-on bag wasn’t helping me keep the pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I almost tripped again rushing down an incline. I cursed to myself, startling several children and their parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gave a quiet nod of apology, and hurried on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The baggage claim was close now. I ignored the bright lights of the gift shop. I ignored the divine smell of the bagel shop and all its equally decedent toppings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being late would mean travelling here for nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I couldn’t have travelled all the way across the world (and wasted all that money) just to turn back around again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I did the only sane thing a normal person would do: I ran.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything around me became a blur. I almost ran into an elderly lady with one too many bags in my rush.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was out of breath by the time I got to the baggage claim. My heavy breathing caught the attention of everyone in the immediate area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embarrassed, I caught my composure as I finally realized that I was early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course. My flight had come late anyway. It’s not like my bags would have arrived any faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a sigh, I sat down at one of seats nearby to catch my breath. I couldn’t help but notice how beautiful the airport was. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The seats were a jet black colored leather, with clear steel frame. They were sturdy, enough to carry the people and the trouble they carried. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The walls were covered with paintings from all over the globe. Some told stories, while others depicted historical events of the city’s history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a picture that depicted the fall of the Roman Empire, and one that depicted one of the rise of the Byzantine Empire (the ones who succeeded the Roman Empire).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One picture reminded me of a story my mother used to tell when I was little. It was about this traveler, who traveled among the ancient civilizations like an ambassador. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ambassador was kind, intelligent, and well respected. 
                </p>
                        <p>
                    He was tall, <span style = "color: yellow">blonde</span>, and good looking. Dreamy, as my mother would put it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She told me that he wore white, with little other color mixed in. My mother called it a symbol of hope. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mom told tales about him for years, until I went to college. She could have written a book on the stories she told. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I convinced her to do that five years ago, the summer before my freshman year. On instinct, I reached down to the unfinished copy of ‘TXT.EXE’ in carry-on bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A strange title for a book, I know, but I was never able to convince her to change the title to something like “Black Snow”. Mom was always stubborn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn’t long before a man, around forty or fifty years in age, came and sat down next to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He carried about him an aura of confidence. If the man’s hair wasn’t <span style = "color: gray">gray</span>, he could have easily passed for a man in his late twenties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The neck pillow, sweatpants, and headphones at his side indicated that this man was an experienced traveler (at least that’s what my friend Mark told me before I left).
                </p>
                <p>He proceeded to sit down next to me, out of all the empty seats in the room. He placed his stuff down at his feet, and reclined with a groan.</p>
                <p>
                    “Got any tips?” I asked the man.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an instant, he replied. “Wear comfortable shoes”, he responded. That caught me off guard. I had expected him to ask for context, but it was like he had read my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He smiled. “Where are you from kid?” he asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “New York City”, I replied. “Just graduated from college, top of my class.” An achievement I was proud of, without a doubt. It probably showed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He smiled again. “You parents must be proud”. Whatever pride I had felt in that moment instantly faded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People tell stories about how a traumatic moment caused their lives to flash before their eyes. It all happens in an instant, they say. 
                    That happened whenever someone mentioned my parents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They had been kind people, my parents. My father was well muscled, like a football player. His blond hair was always messy. My mom always complained about it, and all he did was chuckle. He was stubborn like that. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most noticeable feature about him, however, was his eyes. They were colored <span style = "color: blue">ocean blue</span>, glowing like those night lights that I (over)used as a kid.
                </p>
                <p>My mother was highly intelligent. She was offered a government position straight out of college, but declined “because she didn’t want anything to do with politics”. Instead, she chose the humble life of an author. </p>
                <p>
                    She wrote a lot of books. Most of these books didn’t sell well though. She always remained positive, however.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    I missed my parents.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    The man’s smile instantly faded. 
                </p>
                 <p>
                    “Sorry if I crossed a line”, he said. “Would you like to talk about it?”
                </p>
